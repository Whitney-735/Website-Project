      "contents": "\nIssue of using R-squared\nAs taught in my Statistic class, R-squared is an important value to look for in order to find the fitness of the regression model. However, the validity of the R-squared from generated model is unknown to us. If the R-squared provided is not reliable, the results derived from the model will be misled and incorrectly interpreted. Therefore, R-squared should be cautiously used when testing the fitness of a model.\nR-squared does not measure goodness of fit 1\nIt can be arbitrarily low when the model is completely correct.* By making\\(σ^2\\) large, we drive R-squared towards 0, even when every assumption of the simple linear regression model is correct in every particular.\nWhat is \\(σ^2\\)? When we perform linear regression, we assume our model almost predicts our dependent variable. The difference between “almost” and “exact” is assumed to be a draw from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and some variance we call \\(σ^2\\).\nThis statement is easy enough to demonstrate. The way we do it here is to create a function that (1) generates data meeting the assumptions of simple linear regression (independent observations, normally distributed errors with constant variance), (2) fits a simple linear model to the data, and (3) reports the R-squared. Notice the only parameter for sake of simplicity is sigma. We then “apply” this function to a series of increasing \\(σ\\) values and plot the results.\n\n\nr2.0 <- function(sig){\n  # our predictor\n  x <- seq(1,10,length.out = 100)   \n  # our response; a function of x plus some random noise\n  y <- 2 + 1.2*x + rnorm(100,0,sd = sig) \n  # print the R-squared value\n  summary(lm(y ~ x))$r.squared          \n}\nsigmas <- seq(0.5,20,length.out = 20)\n # apply our function to a series of sigma values\nrout <- sapply(sigmas, r2.0)            \nplot(rout ~ sigmas, type=\"b\")\n\n\n\n\nR-squared tanks hard with increasing sigma, even though the model is completely correct in every respect.\nR-squared can be arbitrarily close to 1 when the model is totally wrong2\nThe point being made is that R-squared does not measure goodness of fit.\n\n\nset.seed(1)\n# our predictor is data from an exponential distribution\nx <- rexp(50,rate=0.005)\n# non-linear data generation\ny <- (x-1)^2 * runif(50, min=0.8, max=1.2) \n# clearly non-linear\nplot(x,y)             \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(lm(y ~ x))$r.squared\n\n\n[1] 0.8485146\n\nIt’s very high at about 0.85, but the model is completely wrong. Using R-squared to justify the “goodness” of our model in this instance would be a mistake. Hopefully one would plot the data first and recognize that a simple linear regression in this case would be inappropriate.\nSuggestion\nIn addition to what explained above, R-squared does not either necessarily increase when assumptions are better satisfied or measure how one variable explains another. When we try to measure the fitness of regression model, adjusted R-squared provides a good measure about the model.\n\nhttps://data.library.virginia.edu/is-r-squared-useless/↩︎\nhttps://data.library.virginia.edu/is-r-squared-useless/↩︎\n",
